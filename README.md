 # Automated deep learning model to identify sexist comments and to replace them
 This repository contains the code related to our research work "A Review of an Automated Model for Sexist Language Detection and Replacement of Sexist Terms" was presented at the AAIMB 2023 and will be published in the upcoming springer book series.

 ## Goal of this work
 - to develop a system that can automatically detect obscene comments in social media and also replace it with another word.
   
 ## List of contents in this Repo
 ml all algos with all scores - contains the code base for all ml algorithms that was experimented in this work
 lstm is the best - contains the LSTM implementation for the experiment
 Bi-lstm is also the best - contains the Bi-LSTM implementation for this experiment

 More results will be out in the paper!
